Skewness and Future Returns: 60-Month Lagged Regression Analysis

Introduction

Skewness is often thought of as a measure of asymmetry in the distribution of market returns ￼. In finance research, the skewness of past returns has been explored as a predictor of future performance. For example, studies have found that a higher recent skewness (especially positive skewness, indicating more frequent big upside moves) is associated with lower subsequent returns ￼ – investors pay a premium for “lottery-like” payoff profiles, depressing future returns. In this task, we analyze whether the skewness of past returns for European (EU) equity sector indices can predict their next-month returns. We will perform lagged predictive regressions using trailing periods from 1 up to 60 months, for each sector separately and also in a pooled panel. This comprehensive approach (testing up to a 5-year window) follows the common practice of using ~60 months of data to estimate skewness measures ￼. The goal is to determine if skewness has significant predictive power for future returns and at what horizons.

Data Preparation

Data Input: We start with a DataFrame df_prices of monthly EU sector index prices. The DataFrame’s index is datetime (month-end dates), and each column represents a different sector index (e.g., Energy, Financials, etc.). Before analysis, we convert the price data into monthly returns. We use simple arithmetic returns (percentage change month-over-month), since the horizon is one month (log-returns and simple returns are very similar for single periods). Using pandas, we can do this in one step and drop the first NaN row:

# Convert prices to monthly returns (percentage change)
df_returns = df_prices.pct_change().dropna()

This yields a DataFrame of monthly returns for each sector, aligned by date. For example, if df_prices had values like 100 at Jan-end and 105 at Feb-end for a sector, the Feb return would be 0.05 (5%). We ensure the DataFrame is sorted by date and has a consistent monthly frequency. Each column in df_returns will be used for sector-specific analysis.

Per-Sector Lagged Regressions

For each sector, we conduct 60 separate OLS regressions, one for each lag length h = 1 to 60 months. In each regression, the independent variable (X) is the skewness of trailing returns over the past h months, and the dependent variable (Y) is the forward one-month return. Formally, for each month T (after at least h months of data available), we compute:
	•	X(T) = Skewness of cumulative returns from T–h to T. In practice, since we have monthly returns, this is the skewness of the set of the last h monthly returns up to time T. Skewness is calculated as the third central moment of returns divided by the cube of their standard deviation, indicating whether the distribution has a longer tail on one side ￼. (Note: A minimum of 3 data points is required to compute a meaningful skewness; for very small windows h<3, skewness is undefined or set to 0 by convention.)
	•	Y(T) = Forward 1-month return from T to T+1. This is simply the return in the next month following T.

Each regression uses all time periods T for which we can compute X(T) (i.e. from the first available T that has h trailing returns, up until the second-to-last month since we need T+1 for Y). We estimate a simple linear model:

￼

using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). Here, $\beta$ is the slope coefficient that captures the predictive power of skewness on next-month return. For each regression we record: the coefficient $\beta$, its t-statistic, the p-value testing $\beta=0$, and the R² of the regression. A significant t-statistic (|t| large, p < 0.05) would indicate that skewness is a statistically significant predictor for that lag window h.

We implement this in a loop for each sector. Below is a simplified code snippet illustrating the procedure for one sector (the actual script repeats this for all sectors):

import statsmodels.api as sm

results = {}  # to collect results DataFrame for each sector
for sector in df_returns.columns:
    sector_ret = df_returns[sector].dropna()
    res_list = []
    for h in range(1, 61):
        # Compute trailing skewness over last h months:
        X = sector_ret.rolling(window=h).skew()  
        # Forward 1-month return:
        Y = sector_ret.shift(-1)  
        # Align data and drop NaNs (insufficient periods or last month with no forward return)
        data = pd.DataFrame({'X': X, 'Y': Y}).dropna()
        if len(data) < 3:
            # Skip if not enough data points to regress (e.g., h=1,2 or near end)
            continue
        # OLS regression Y ~ X (with intercept)
        model = sm.OLS(data['Y'], sm.add_constant(data['X'])).fit()
        beta = model.params['X']
        t_val = model.tvalues['X']
        p_val = model.pvalues['X']
        r2   = model.rsquared
        res_list.append({'h': h, 'coef': beta, 't': t_val, 'p': p_val, 'R2': r2})
    # Convert results to DataFrame (index = lag h)
    results[sector] = pd.DataFrame(res_list).set_index('h')

In this code, sector_ret.rolling(window=h).skew() computes the trailing skewness of the last h returns at each time (pandas uses the unbiased sample skewness). We use Y = sector_ret.shift(-1) so that the return at T+1 is aligned as the prediction target for time T. We drop NaNs to remove periods where we couldn’t compute skewness (e.g., the first h-1 months) or where forward return is not available (the last month in the series). We then run an OLS regression using statsmodels and collect the results.

The outcome for each sector is a DataFrame (stored in results[sector]) with 60 rows (for h=1 to 60, or fewer if early lags were skipped due to insufficient data) and columns: coef, t, p, R2. For example, a snippet of the results for a sector might look like:

h	coef	t-stat	p-value	R²
3	0.002048	0.896	0.371	0.0034
4	0.001079	0.389	0.698	0.0006
5	–0.000455	–0.138	0.890	0.0001
6	–0.002675	–0.720	0.472	0.0022
…	…	…	…	…

In this illustrative output, for lag h=3 to 6 the coefficients are small and p-values are large (above 0.05), indicating no significant relationship – which we’d expect if there’s truly no predictive effect. We would repeat similar rows up to h=60 for each sector. (Lags 1 and 2 are omitted here because skewness with <3 points is not defined – our code skips those.)

Pooled Panel Regression

In addition to sector-by-sector analysis, we perform pooled regressions combining all sector data. The idea is to see if there is an overall relationship between skewness and next-month returns when ignoring sector-specific differences (i.e. treating all observations from all sectors as one sample). For each lag h = 1,…,60, we create a pooled dataset of $(X, Y)$ pairs from all sectors and months. Specifically, for each sector we compute the series of X(T) (h-month skewness) and Y(T) (next-month return) as before, then stack or concatenate these series across sectors. This gives one large sample of observations for that horizon h. We then run a single OLS regression $Y ~ X$ on this pooled sample. We again store $\beta$, t-statistic, p-value, and R² for each h in a pooled results DataFrame.

Pseudo-code for pooling (inside a loop over h) is as follows:

pooled_res = []
for h in range(1, 61):
    X_all = []
    Y_all = []
    for sector in df_returns.columns:
        X = df_returns[sector].rolling(window=h).skew()
        Y = df_returns[sector].shift(-1)
        data = pd.DataFrame({'X': X, 'Y': Y}).dropna()
        # Append sector's observations for this h
        X_all.extend(data['X'].values)
        Y_all.extend(data['Y'].values)
    # Run pooled OLS if we have enough data points
    if len(X_all) >= 3:
        model = sm.OLS(pd.Series(Y_all), sm.add_constant(pd.Series(X_all))).fit()
        beta = model.params[1]   # index 0 is constant, 1 is X
        t_val = model.tvalues[1]
        p_val = model.pvalues[1]
        r2   = model.rsquared
    else:
        beta = t_val = p_val = r2 = np.nan
    pooled_res.append({'h': h, 'coef': beta, 't': t_val, 'p': p_val, 'R2': r2})
pooled_df = pd.DataFrame(pooled_res).set_index('h')

After this loop, pooled_df contains the regression results for each horizon h when all sector data are pooled together. Typically, pooling increases the sample size (here roughly N ≈ (number of sectors) × (months of data)), which can raise statistical power. If skewness has a consistent effect across sectors, the pooled regression might detect it even if individual-sector regressions are noisy. However, one must be cautious: if different sectors have structurally different behaviors, a simple pooled OLS (with no sector fixed-effects) could be misleading. In our context, we are simply looking for any broad evidence of predictability. We also note the R² values are expectedly very small (usually < 0.5% in our results), which is common in single-factor return regressions – most of next month’s return variance is unexplained (skewness, if significant, might explain only a tiny fraction ￼).

Results and Visualization

We now have a results DataFrame for each sector and one for the pooled regression. To interpret them more easily, we create visualizations of the t-statistics of the skewness coefficient for all 60 lags. High absolute t-values indicate stronger evidence that $\beta \neq 0$. Figures are plotted as bar charts of t-values versus the lag length h. We highlight bars in a different color when the coefficient is statistically significant (p < 0.05). This way, we can quickly see at which horizons (if any) skewness has a significant predictive effect.

T-statistics of skewness coefficients for each sector’s 60 lagged regressions. Each subplot corresponds to one sector (10 EU sectors shown). The x-axis is the lag window length in months (1 to 60) and the y-axis is the t-value of the regression coefficient $\beta$. Bars are colored red if the coefficient is significant at p < 0.05, and blue otherwise. A horizontal line at t=0 is shown for reference. In this example (with synthetic data), most t-values hover near zero (no effect), and only a few scattered lags show nominal significance.

T-statistics from the pooled panel regression (all sectors combined) as a function of lag length. The format is similar: red bars indicate lags where skewness is a significant predictor at the 5% level. In our illustration, some longer-horizon windows show clusters of “significance” (red bars), but this pattern is likely due to random chance in the simulated data. In real data, a consistent run of significant t-values across adjacent lags could indicate a genuine predictive relationship. For instance, if many bars are red and predominantly positive or negative, it would suggest that skewness has a systematic effect on next-month returns (e.g., a negative $\beta$ across many lags would align with evidence that higher skewness predicts lower future returns ￼).

Each sector’s chart allows us to see if that particular sector had any specific horizon where skewness mattered. The pooled chart aggregates information and might reveal an overall effect. If the analysis were run on actual EU sector indices, we would look for patterns such as a particular range of lags yielding significant t-statistics consistently, or perhaps one sector (say, Technology) showing many red bars (significant predictive power) whereas another (say, Utilities) shows none – indicating skewness matters for some sectors but not others. In the pooled results, a significant $\beta$ (especially if stable across adjacent lags) would suggest a more universal effect of skewness on subsequent returns.

Finally, the script saves the figures to image files (e.g., "sector_t_values.png" and "pooled_t_values.png") and if run in an interactive environment (like Jupyter Notebook), displays them inline as shown above. The results DataFrames (results per sector and pooled_df) are readily available for further inspection or tabulation. By structuring the code in a modular way (loops and reusable computations for X and Y), we ensure the analysis is clear and each step (data prep, regression, output) is well-organized. This allows easy extension — for example, one could add code to compute rolling-window out-of-sample tests or include control variables — but as is, the output above comprehensively addresses the question of skewness’s predictive power on EU sector returns across 1 to 60 month horizons.

Predictive Power of Skewness on Future Returns: Methodology & Python Script

Introduction

Understanding whether past return skewness has predictive power for future returns is an intriguing question in finance. Skewness measures the asymmetry of the return distribution; a positive skew implies a long right tail (occasional large positive returns), whereas negative skew indicates a long left tail (downside risk). Investors are not indifferent to skewness – theories suggest that many investors prefer positive skewness (lottery-like payoffs) and dislike negative skewness. In fact, an equilibrium model by Barberis & Huang (2008) predicts that assets with more positive skewness tend to earn lower subsequent returns, as investors bid up their prices ￼. Empirical studies have supported this: for example, stocks with high idiosyncratic skewness have significantly lower future returns on average ￼. This reflects a potential “lottery effect,” where investors accept lower returns for a chance of extreme upside. On the other hand, skewness can also represent a risk factor – systematic skewness (covariance of an asset’s returns with market skewness) appears to command a risk premium ￼, meaning investors demand higher returns for exposure to negative skewness (downside tail risk).

Given this context, we examine the time-series predictive power of skewness for future returns using EU sector equity index data. Specifically, we will compute rolling skewness of monthly returns for each sector and test if it forecasts the next month’s return. We outline the methodology step-by-step and provide a detailed Python script to perform the analysis. The goal is to determine if a sector’s past return distribution shape (skewness) contains information about its upcoming performance. We will run predictive OLS regressions for a range of skewness lookback windows (h = 1 to 60 months) for each sector and in a pooled sample across sectors. Finally, we interpret the regression results in light of expectations and literature, noting practical challenges like overlapping data and typically low R² in return predictions.

Data and Preprocessing

Data: We assume we have monthly price data for a set of European sector equity indices (for example, STOXX Europe 600 sector sub-indices or similar). The data should cover a reasonably long period (several decades if possible) to support rolling windows up to 60 months (5 years) and leave enough out-of-sample points for regression. Each sector’s price series is indexed by date.

Converting Prices to Returns: The first step is to convert monthly price levels into monthly returns. This can be done as simple arithmetic returns (percentage change) or log returns. For ease of interpretation, we use simple returns:
￼
where ￼ is the index price at month t. It’s important to ensure the dates are properly aligned (e.g. end-of-month prices) and to handle any missing data or index rebase splicing if necessary. After this step, we have a time series of monthly returns for each sector. These returns will be the basis for computing skewness and will also serve as our dependent variable in predictive regressions (shifted by one month for forward returns).

Note: If the data includes dividends (total return indices) or not can affect returns; ideally use total return indices to capture full return. Also, one may use log returns for theoretical ease (they add up over time), but for small monthly returns the difference is minor. We proceed with percentage (arithmetic) returns for simplicity.

Rolling Skewness Calculation

What is Skewness? Skewness is the third central moment of a distribution (normalized by the cube of standard deviation) and quantifies asymmetry. We will compute rolling skewness of returns to capture the shape of the return distribution in recent history. A positive skewness means more weight in the right tail (occasional big up moves), while negative skewness means a heavier left tail (more extreme down moves).

Rolling Window: For each sector index, we compute rolling skewness over varying window lengths h = 1 to 60 months. This means for each month t, we look back at the past h months’ returns (including month t itself) and calculate the sample skewness of those returns. In formula terms, for a given horizon h:
￼
where the sums are over the last h returns up to time t (and ￼ is their mean). We require at least 3 data points to compute a meaningful skewness (with 1 or 2 points the sample skewness is not defined), so effectively the minimum window is h=3. (In our implementation, for h < 3 the skewness will be NaN and those periods will be skipped in regressions.) We will calculate skewness for every month where a full h-month history is available. This yields a time series of skewness values for each sector and each horizon h.

Aligning Skewness with Forward Returns: The skewness computed at time t (using returns up to t) will be used to predict the forward return for time t+1. In other words, we align the data such that:
	•	Predictor = skewness over months [t-h+1, …, t]
	•	Response = return in month t+1

This ensures a proper chronological order: at the end of month t, we can calculate the trailing h-month skewness, and then ask if this number predicts what happens in the next month. There is no look-ahead bias, since only past and present data up to t is used to predict the future return. Concretely, if we have returns from January 2010 to December 2020, a 12-month skewness for December 2020 would be computed from Jan–Dec 2020 returns, and we would align it with the return of January 2021. We perform this alignment for each month in the sample (except the final month, which cannot predict a “next” return).

One important detail is that skewness windows overlap heavily from month to month, especially for large h. For example, a 60-month skewness in December and in November share 59 out of 60 data points. This means the skewness time series has strong autocorrelation. While this does not invalidate the regression, it does imply that successive observations of the predictor are not independent. We will discuss the impact of this in the interpretation and how it might require caution in statistical inference (e.g., adjusting standard errors).

OLS Regression Setup

With the skewness predictor and forward return response lined up, we conduct ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions to test predictive power. The regression model (for each sector and each horizon) is:

￼

where ￼ is the next month’s return and ￼ is the skewness of the last h months’ returns (up to month t). We estimate the intercept α and slope β using OLS. The slope coefficient β is of primary interest: it measures the predictive relationship between skewness and future return. A significant β (t-statistic far from zero, p-value below 0.05) would indicate that skewness has forecasting ability for returns. The sign of β tells the direction of the effect:
	•	β < 0: Negative relation – high skewness predicts lower future returns. This would be consistent with the “lottery demand” hypothesis (investors bid up positively skewed assets, lowering their subsequent returns) ￼ ￼.
	•	β > 0: Positive relation – high skewness predicts higher future returns. This could suggest that a period of negative skewness (left-tail events) precedes rebounds, or that investors demand a risk premium for skewness (assets with more downside skewness have higher expected returns to compensate) ￼.

We run these regressions in two ways:
	1.	Per-Sector Regressions: For each sector individually, we run 60 separate regressions (one for each skewness window h = 1,…,60). This gives us sector-specific results – β estimates, t-stats, etc. – as a function of the skewness horizon. We can observe if certain sectors show stronger predictive patterns or if the effect is consistently insignificant.
	2.	Pooled Regression: For each horizon h, we also run a regression pooled across all sectors. This means we combine the data from all sectors into one big sample for that horizon and estimate a common regression ￼. Essentially, we ignore sector distinctions (or equivalently assume the relationship β is the same for all sectors) to increase sample size. The pooled β tells us the overall tendency across sectors. We will get 60 pooled regressions (one per horizon). Note: The pooled approach implicitly weights each sector equally (if each provides one observation per month). One could also do a panel regression with sector fixed effects on the intercept – but since we are only including skewness as a predictor, a pooled OLS on stacked data is effectively the same, just giving a common slope. We assume each sector’s monthly observations are independent for OLS; however, to be rigorous, one might cluster standard errors by time or sector if there are common shocks, but for simplicity we proceed with plain OLS.

For each regression, we will store the key outputs: β coefficient, its t-statistic and p-value, and the regression R² (adjusted R²). Storing these in a structured format (e.g., a DataFrame indexed by horizon) allows us to analyze how the predictive power evolves with the window length. We expect R² values to be very low (often only a few percent or less), which is typical in monthly return prediction since most return variation is unexplained noise. For instance, one study found that even a significant skewness predictor yielded an R² around 1.5% ￼ – in our case, many regressions may have R² near 0%. We should be prepared for that and focus on the statistical significance and consistency of β across horizons.

Execution and Results Storage

We outline the procedure to run the regressions and store results step by step:
	1.	Prepare Data Structures: After computing the returns DataFrame (with columns as sectors and rows as dates), we will create an empty results DataFrame for each sector and one for pooled results. These will have index 1 to 60 (horizons) and columns for β, t-stat, p-value, R².
	2.	Loop Over Horizons: For each horizon h from 1 to 60:
	•	Compute the rolling skewness for each sector’s returns using window = h. This yields, for each sector, a series of skewness values (NaN for the first h-1 periods).
	•	Align with forward returns: shift the return series by -1 to represent ￼. For each sector, pair up each available skewness value at time t with the return at t+1. Those (skew, future return) pairs form the regression dataset for that sector at that horizon.
	•	Run an OLS regression for the sector: regress future return on skewness (with an intercept). We use Python’s statsmodels to get coefficient and t-stat easily. Save β, t-stat, p, R² into that sector’s results table at row = h.
	•	Also collect all sector data for this horizon into a pooled dataset (simply concatenating the sector-specific (skew, return) pairs). Once we have iterated over all sectors, run one OLS on the pooled data for horizon h and store its results (β, t, p, R²) in the pooled results table.
	3.	Repeat for all horizons. This yields a complete set of outputs.

This looping approach will result in e.g. a DataFrame sector_results['Financials'] with 60 rows (horizons) and the regression stats for that sector, and a pooled_results DataFrame with 60 rows for the pooled regression at each horizon.

We will have the Python script to perform this in the next section. The script will also include optional code to generate visualizations – for instance, plotting the t-statistics of β against the horizon. Such plots (e.g., a bar chart of t-values for each window length) can highlight at which horizons, if any, skewness has the most predictive power and whether those t-stats exceed the typical significance threshold (~±2). We might produce one chart per sector and one for the pooled regression. Visual inspection can complement the numeric output when interpreting results.

Interpretation of Results

After running the regressions, we interpret the findings both statistically and in economic context:
	•	Significance of β: We check which (if any) horizons yield a statistically significant β for each sector. It’s possible that no horizon is significant (implying skewness is not a reliable predictor for that sector’s next-month return), or there might be sporadic horizons with p < 0.05. Due to the multiple tests (60 horizons), a few significant at 5% could occur by chance – consistency across neighboring horizons or across sectors would lend more credibility to a true effect. If we see, for example, that horizons around 12-18 months give a consistently negative and significant β in multiple sectors, that might indicate a real pattern (perhaps a business cycle length effect). Conversely, isolated significance at, say, h=17 only might be noise.
	•	Sign of β: If we find negative β coefficients (especially if significant), it suggests that when a sector’s returns have been positively skewed, the subsequent return tends to be lower. This aligns with the idea that recent “lottery-like” run-ups or positive tail events in a sector might lead to a pullback or that investors’ skewness-loving behavior drives prices up and future returns down ￼ ￼. On the other hand, a positive β would imply sectors with recent negative skew (heavy downside tail) see higher rebound returns – possibly a mean-reversion or compensation for distress. Economic theory provides some guidance: many studies document a negative relation between idiosyncratic skewness and future returns in the cross-section ￼, so we might expect a negative β if anything. However, it is also conceivable that at an index/sector level, periods of extreme downside (negative skew) are followed by recoveries (positive β for skewness predictor). Thus, the sign is ultimately an empirical question here.
	•	Magnitude of β: We interpret the magnitude in terms of economic significance. For example, if β = -0.2 (and say skewness is measured in conventional units), it means a 1-unit increase in skewness leads to a 0.2 unit decrease in next month return. If a one-standard-deviation change in skewness is, say, 0.5, then that corresponds to a 0.1 (10%) change in monthly return, which would be huge. More likely, we’ll find β on the order of a few hundredths. In one related study, the coefficient on a skewness measure was about -0.1425 when skewness was measured in standardized units, implying a 0.59% drop in next-month return per std.dev of skewness ￼. So we expect any effect to be modest in return percentage terms, even if statistically significant.
	•	R² (Predictive Power): We anticipate low R² values for all regressions. It’s common in return prediction that R² is under 2-3% for even the best predictors ￼. Many of our regressions may have R² near 0%. A low R² does not mean the result is useless – it just reflects that monthly returns are very volatile. Even a significant predictor that improves forecasting odds might only explain a tiny fraction of variance. For instance, a predictor could have an economically meaningful effect on expected return while actual outcomes still vary widely. We should caution that a regression with R² = 0.5% and p ~0.05 may still indicate a real effect, but one that is overwhelmed by noise in any single month.
	•	Comparing Horizons: We will look at how results change with the skewness window length. A shorter window skewness (e.g., h = 3 or 6 months) captures short-term asymmetry, whereas a long window (60 months) captures a multi-year shape of returns. It could be that short-term skewness (maybe reflecting a recent jump or crash) has more impact on the next month than very long-term skewness (which might include many different regimes). Alternatively, a longer window might smooth out noise and capture a “trend” in skewness. If we observe no clear pattern or significance at any horizon, it suggests skewness (regardless of how measured) isn’t a useful predictor for these indices’ next-month returns.
	•	Sector Differences: By comparing sector-specific regressions, we might find that certain sectors have stronger skewness-return relationships. For example, “defensive” sectors (utilities, consumer staples) might have different distribution shapes and investor behavior than “speculative” sectors (technology, biotech). It could be that speculative sectors, which occasionally experience big booms (high positive skew) or crashes, exhibit a more pronounced negative skewness effect. Defensive sectors with steadier returns might show little to no skewness effect. If the pooled regression shows significance but individual ones don’t, it might indicate a subtle effect that only emerges with a larger sample size.
	•	Challenges and Considerations: One challenge is the overlapping data in skewness calculations. While our dependent variable (next-month return) is non-overlapping (each month’s return is separate), the independent variable for adjacent observations shares most of the window. This can induce autocorrelation in regression residuals – violating the OLS assumption of independent errors. If serial correlation in residuals is present, the OLS standard errors could be underestimated. A common remedy in predictive regressions with overlapping observations (especially if we were predicting multi-month ahead returns) is to use Newey-West heteroskedasticity-and-autocorrelation-consistent (HAC) standard errors ￼. In our one-month ahead case, the main overlap is in the predictor, not the horizon of the return, so the serial correlation in errors might be mild, but one could still apply Newey-West (with an appropriate lag) to be safe. Additionally, running 60 separate regressions raises multiple comparison concerns – if one mines the results, there’s a chance of finding a “significant” horizon just by luck. A more robust analysis might formally test across all horizons or use an out-of-sample evaluation to guard against overfitting. Our aim here, however, is an exploratory in-sample analysis.
	•	Literature Context: It’s worth noting how our time-series sector-level analysis fits in the broader literature. Prior studies often look at cross-sectional effects of skewness (e.g., which stocks subsequently earn less), or the market-level effect (using aggregate skewness to predict market returns). For example, one study found that the market’s own skewness (e.g., skewness of S&P 500 index returns) did not significantly predict its future returns ￼. However, measures like the average skewness of individual stocks have shown predictive power for market returns ￼. The interpretation is that when many stocks have lottery-like return distributions (high average skewness), the market tends to perform worse going forward, perhaps due to excessive risk-taking or overvaluation ￼. Our sector-based approach is somewhat in between: we are effectively seeing if a sector’s “internal” return asymmetry foreshadows its performance. If we find a consistent negative β, it would resonate with the idea that skewness contains an element of sentiment or preference that affects pricing. If we find no effect, it suggests skewness might already be impounded in prices with no predictive info, or simply that our sample (EU sectors) doesn’t exhibit the anomaly that individual stocks do. Either outcome is informative.

In summary, when interpreting the regression outputs, emphasis should be placed on the sign and significance of the skewness coefficient (β) and recognizing that any predictive power is likely small in magnitude (low R²) and possibly sensitive to sample period or market conditions. Now, having described the methodology and interpretative framework, we provide the full Python script that performs the analysis so the user can apply this to their EU sector index data.

Python Script for Skewness Predictive Analysis

Below is the Python script that implements the entire analysis. It is well-commented to explain each step. The script reads in monthly price data, computes returns, calculates rolling skewness for horizons 1 to 60, aligns them with forward returns, runs OLS regressions (sector-wise and pooled), and stores the results. It also includes optional sections to generate bar chart visualizations of t-statistics for each horizon. The user can adapt file paths and other minor details as needed.

# End of script

Notes on the Script:
	•	The code uses pandas for rolling calculations and statsmodels for regression. Ensure these libraries are installed (pip install pandas statsmodels matplotlib if needed).
	•	We assumed a CSV input; the user should adjust the file path ('eu_sector_indices.csv') and parsing as necessary. The data should be structured with one column per sector’s price and a date index. If the data is in Excel, one can use pd.read_excel similarly.
	•	The rolling(window=h).skew() function by default computes sample skewness (Fisher-Pearson coefficient) which is what we want. It handles the necessary degrees of freedom internally. The first h-1 values will be NaN as there’s not enough data to compute skewness.
	•	We drop NaNs after combining skewness and forward return; this naturally drops the initial periods where skewness isn’t available and the last period where we don’t have a forward return.
	•	We use model.rsquared (unadjusted R²) for simplicity; for a single predictor, adjusted R² would be very similar since ￼ in each regression. One could use model.rsquared_adj as well.
	•	The results are saved to CSV files for convenience, so the user can inspect them in Excel or use them for making tables. This is optional.
	•	The visualization part creates bar plots for t-statistics. We add horizontal lines at ±2 to indicate the rough threshold for significance at 5% (under normal approximation). These plots can quickly show if t-stats are mostly below 2 in absolute value (no significance) or if some bars stand out beyond ±2. We do one plot per sector and one for pooled; depending on the number of sectors, this could produce many charts. The user can modify or comment out this section if not needed or if running in a non-interactive environment.
	•	If running in an interactive notebook (like Jupyter), the plt.show() commands will display the plots inline. In a script, they would pop up windows (or you could save figures with plt.savefig).

Conclusion

This analysis framework allows us to rigorously test whether the skewness of past returns contains predictive information for future returns in EU sector indices. By examining 60 different rolling window lengths for skewness, we can assess over what horizon (if any) skewness matters most. The provided methodology and code give a comprehensive approach: from data processing to regression and result interpretation.

In an example outcome (not shown here with actual data), one might find, for instance, that β is negative for most sectors but not statistically significant, suggesting no strong skewness effect – or perhaps one sector (say, Technology) shows a significantly negative β around h=12-24 months, aligning with the notion that that sector’s occasional booms lead to corrections. The pooled regression might show a mildly negative β with a t-stat near the threshold, hinting at a weak overall effect. Such results would be consistent with existing literature that finds only modest predictive power for skewness and typically low R² (on the order of 1% or less) ￼. If instead a clear pattern emerged (e.g., several sectors showing p<0.01 for h around 6 months with β > 0), that would be an intriguing deviation, warranting further investigation and potentially a search for economic reasons behind it.

Finally, it’s important to contextualize these findings: a lack of significance does not mean skewness is unimportant – it may still be priced in expected returns (as a risk factor or preference) without being easily exploitable for prediction. Conversely, finding significance would provide evidence that distributional characteristics of returns (beyond variance) have a role in short-term market dynamics. We have also highlighted challenges like overlapping window data and multiple comparisons; any positive findings should be tested for robustness (e.g., out-of-sample tests, different time periods, controlling for other predictors like momentum or volatility).

By following the outlined steps and using the script, the user can reproduce the analysis on their dataset, adapt parameters (such as different return horizons or including control variables), and further explore the relationship between skewness and future returns in financial markets. The combination of a step-by-step methodology discussion and a fully functional code ensures that the approach is transparent and easily transferable to similar predictive studies in finance.
